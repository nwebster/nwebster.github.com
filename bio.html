<h1> Nathan Webster  </h1>
<h3> A bit about myself: </h3>
<p> My name is Nate Webster and I am a current junior at Tufts University. I am majoring in Quantitative Economics,<br> but I have also taken numerous classes in Computer Science and French. I am also very involved in Tufts Student Resources<br> and my fraternity here at Tufts. I am originally from a different suburb of Boston that is a teeny town, only known for its fair.<br> As far as my hobbies go, I am an avid skier, soccer player, and I enjoy reading most dragon books. <br> Also, I think it is worth mentioning that I am enjoying my time in Comp20 thus far, despite the challenges of github. </p>
